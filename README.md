# Transfer-Learning-OpenCv-XGBoost-CNN
Plant seedlings classification using XGBoost in combination with transfer learning, OpenCV and CNN. We used weights from pre trained VGG19 model to take tha advantage of transfer learning to train a classification model to determine different specied of seelings.
